For such customers, administrators may now generate a midterm invoice.    </p><p> </p><p>Let’s assume that the company EasyCall, which has a monthly billing period, conducted a successful marketing campaign. Thus, EasyCall’s service usage is unexpectedly high at the beginning of the month. Instead of paying a lot of money at the end of the billing period, the company wants to pay for their services consumed up to the middle of the month (May 13th), and informs the administrator about this. On May 14th, the administrator generates a midterm invoice, which covers the period from the May 1st until the May 13th. The invoice is then immediately sent to EasyCall. This way, the regular invoice that’s generated at the end of the billing period will cover the rest of the period from May 14th until May 31st. </p><p> </p><p>Thus, midterm invoice functionality helps administrators to manage customers who prefer receiving several smaller invoices rather than a single large one, even if the total amount is the same.  </p></div></body></html>
