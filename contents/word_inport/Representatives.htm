Representatives work on behalf of the company, selling services for a commission which is paid by the service provider.</p><p> </p><p>Each sales representative is assigned initials. Their names and initials appear on sales forms, allowing you to associate specific sales representatives with specific sales in order to track their income.</p><p> </p><p>This allows for:</p><ul data-start="1.61" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.61"><li>More accurate reporting of representative performance and commissions.</li><li>Improved customer usage monitoring and analysis.<p>NOTE: Representatives do not participate in billing or revenue sharing. They are listed for information purposes only.</p><h3><a id="_Hlk510697444"></a><a id="_Hlk510700832"></a>Commission calculation for representatives </h3><p>PortaBilling® automatically calculates representatives’ commissions. To make this happen, an administrator creates a commission plan wherein different calculation schemas are defined. </p><p> </p><p>The commission amount depends on:</p></li><li>service type (e.g. subscription, voice calls, etc.);</li><li>commission type:</li><li>a one-time commission – a fixed amount of money that is paid one time only when a new subscription is assigned;</li><li>a percentage commission – a percentage of the customer’s charges for services provided;</li><li>the period – this is the number of months during which a predefined percentage commission is charged (e.g. for the first 3 months, the representative receives 10% of customer charges, for the next 3 months – 7% and for the following months – 5%).<p> </p><p>There are two commission calculation modes that define when a commission is made available to a representative.<br/>‎</p></li><li>Payments.</li><li>PortaBilling® calculates and only makes available a commission once a customer makes a payment for their services. This mode is recommended for prepaid customers. Note that different commission amounts can be configured differently for time periods only. There is no option for differentiating a commission amount by service type and / or commission type.<br/>‎<span></span></li><li>Invoiced amount. </li><li>When a customer is charged, PortaBilling® calculates and makes available the representatives’ commission. This mode permits flexible commission schemas to be configured – for example, to differentiate a commission by service type and apply a one-time commission for subscriptions. Note that a representative may want to receive their commission before the customer has actually paid.<p> </p><p>When a commission is calculated, the representative’s outstanding payout increases.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image81.png" width="900.0" height="553.0" alt="Representative’s outstanding payout"/></p><p> </p><p>Administrators and representatives can generate commission reports where all the commission details are presented (e.g. date, customer name, sum of charges, percentage of commission, etc.).</p><p> </p><p>This is how it works: </p><p> </p></li><li>The administrator creates a commission plan for the new representative, Mark Johnson.</li><li>The administrator then assigns the commission plan to Mark. </li><li>When Mark brings in a new customer, the administrator identifies Mark Johnson as the customer’s representative. Thus, Mark receives a commission from all of his customers according to his commission plan.</li><li>The administrator opens the representative’s profile and sees the amount of money owed by the service provider to the representative.</li><li>The administrator therefore pays Mark his commission and manually decreases the service provider’s debt.<br/>‎<p><span>Consider the following example.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Via Mark Johnson’s commission plan, he will earn: </span></p></li><li>a $15 one-time commission – when the subscription “Equipment rental” is assigned. </li><li>a 2% commission – for use of the $10 monthly “Equipment rental.”</li><li>a 10% commission – on all voice call service charges.</li><li>and a 5% commission – on all other service charges.<br/>‎<p><span> </span><span><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image82.png" width="452.5" height="257.3" alt="Commission plan configuration"/></span></p><p> </p><p><span>At the end of the month, the administrator opens Mark’s profile and sees that the total sum of Mark’s commissions comes to $40.20. A report detailing the commission total is generated:</span></p></li><li>$15 one-time commission for the subscription;</li><li>$0.2 for subscription charge (2% x $10 = $0.2);</li><li>$15 for voice calls charges (10% x $150 = $15);</li><li>$10 for other service charges (5% x $200 = $10).<h4>Override representative’s commission plan </h4><p>It is possible that a service provider and a representative negotiate a different commission scheme for a particular customer. For instance, a representative receives a 5% commission according to his ABC commission plan but he wants a 10% commission for services consumed by the customer GoMobile. To make this happen, the administrator creates an individual commission plan and assigns it to that customer.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image83.png" width="462.1" height="234.9" alt="Override commission plan"/> </p><h4>Currency conversion for representative’s commission </h4><p>It may happen that representatives and the customers they bring in operate in different currencies – e.g. USD and EUR. PortaBilling® automatically converts the currency for representative’s commission.</p><p> </p><p>For instance, let’s say your representative Mark Johnson operates in EUR. One day he earns a $230 commission from his USD customer, so PortaBilling® converts the currency to EUR and Mark Johnson receives his €200 commission.</p><p> </p><p>This allows to identify representatives for customers with various currencies and ensures that representatives’ commission calculations and conversions are correct. </p><h4>Commission payment </h4><p>Commission amounts earned by representatives are shown in the Outstanding payout field. To adjust this sum, the administrator clicks <img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image84.png" width="26.0" height="26.0" alt="Adjust balance"/> and the following options appear:</p></li><li>Record an already paid commission manually – This option decreases the representative’s commission amount when the service provider has already paid it.</li><li>Give the representative a commission – This option allows to enter a commission amount for a particular customer and service and thereby increase a representative’s commission amount. </li><li>Give the representative a bonus – This rewards and encourages representatives: an administrator can issue bonuses – sums of money given in addition to commissions. This increases a representative’s payout amount.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image85.png" width="460.2" height="445.5" alt="Commission payment"/></p><p> </p><p>This feature automates the commission calculation process for representatives. In addition, administrators can define different commission schemas by means of particular commission plans.</p></div></body></html>
