As a result, the fraud traffic profile will be changed for all of the customers / resellers with this customer class assigned. </p><h3><a id="_Hlk27497844"></a>Spending plan</h3><p>Spending plans help service providers minimize losses from fraudulent events.</p><p> </p><p>A spending plan defines an amount of money per day that a customer can spend on calls. PortaBilling® tracks a customer’s daily charges, and increases the spending plan counter by the cost of every call completed. </p><p> </p><p>Once a customer reaches their spending limit, their services are suspended. However, the customer can still make calls to emergency numbers. Regular service usage is reinstated on the following day, once the spending plan is renewed. The renewal time is midnight (00:00:00 in the customer’s billing time zone).</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image213.png" width="461.5" height="170.9" alt="Fraud traffic profile: Spending plan"/></p><p> </p><p>Note that PortaBilling® adds the full call cost to the spending plan counters even if a call is covered by a discount. To illustrate this, let’s say a customer’s quota includes 100 minutes of free calls to France. The regular price defined in the tariff is $0.50 per minute. The customer makes a 5 minute call to France and is charged zero; however, their spending plan is increased by $2.50 ($0.50 * 5 minutes).</p><p> </p><p>For each spending plan an administrator can define warning thresholds for receiving notifications when these thresholds’ limits are reached. If a customer has used up their spending plan and wants to continue using the services, an administrator can temporarily increase their spending limit. End users can obtain more information about their spending plans on the customer self-care interface.</p><h4>Spending plan remainder for call authorization</h4><p>PortaBilling® can consider a customer’s remaining spending plan amount during call authorization and re-authorization. If the remaining spending amount is lower than the available funds / credit limit, PortaBilling® uses it to authorize calls. This feature allows you to adjust the maximum permitted duration of calls in accordance to customers’ daily limits, thus minimizing their potential losses in case of fraudulent activities. </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image214.png" width="460.8" height="168.3" alt="Check remaining funds"/></p><p> </p><p>The following example illustrates how it works: </p><p> </p><p>Your SIP trunking customer EasyCall is assigned a $100 spending plan. EasyCall has a credit limit of $1000 USD and a balance of $200 and they are allowed to establish 10 simultaneous calls. When authorizing each new call, PortaBilling®:</p></li><li>checks the customer’s available credit amount ($800) and compares it with the remaining spending amount ($100). </li><li>since $100 is less than $800, PortaBilling® calculates the call duration based on the remaining spending amount ($100). <p> </p><p>Let’s say that a $10 call has just ended. PortaBilling® produces a $10 xDR and applies it to that customer. It also updates the remaining spending amount which now becomes $90. When PortaBilling® authorizes a new call, it calculates the maximum call duration based on this remaining $90. </p><p> </p><p>When any of the calls in progress are re-authorized, PortaBilling® checks the remaining spending amount and calculates the call duration based on that.</p><p> </p><p>Every time a call ends, the remaining spending amount decreases. Accordingly, PortaBilling® reduces the maximum call duration when it authorizes and re-authorizes calls. Once the spending limit is reached, PortaBilling® rejects all following authorization / re-authorization requests. Calls in progress last only for their previously authorized time. </p><p> </p><p>Note that PortaBilling® does not lock funds from the remaining spending amount when it authorizes calls. Therefore, customers may still exceed their spending limit if a call in progress lasts too long and has therefore high cost by the moment the spending limit is reached. For example, if the customer has only $1 left out of the $100 spending limit and the call for $10 ends, their total amount spent becomes $109.</p><p> </p><h4>Spending plan and overdraft protection settings</h4><p>The remainder of the spending amount can override the overdraft protection configuration if it is less than the amount to be locked for a call. </p><p> </p><p>Let’s say that an administrator has configured PortaBilling® to lock at least $10 per call and the customer is allowed to call A-Z destinations for a unified price of $1 /min. The customer’s remaining spending amount is now $8. </p><p> </p><p>When a customer makes a new call, PortaBilling® compares the amount to lock ($10) with the remaining spending amount ($8). Since $8 is less than $10, PortaBilling® reduces the amount to be allocated for the call by up to $8. PortaBilling® then calculates the maximum call duration based on $8. Thus, it authorizes the call to last eight minutes and therefore locks $8.  </p><h4>Deferred spending plan change</h4><p>When an administrator changes a spending plan for a customer (for example, from spending plan A to spending plan B), within the new spending plan they can include the amount already spent. </p></li><li><p>For example, if customer John Doe has a spending plan of 300 USD and has already spent 250 USD, an administrator can change John Doe’s spending plan to 500 USD. Now John Doe can spend 250 USD more (500 USD - 250 USD = 250 USD). </p></li><li></li></ul></li></ul><p>To do this, the administrator needs to choose a desired spending plan and then select the Apply the new spending plan immediately option. This gives the following results:  </p><ul data-start="334" xmlns=""><li>The spending limit (the amount of money the customer may spend on services per day) is changed according to the new spending plan.</li><li>The amount of money the customer has already spent is not reset and continues being calculated.</li><li>The spending plan expiration date and time are not changed. So a customer can use the new spending limit until the previous spending plan expires.    </li></ul><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image215.png" width="460.8" height="225.9" alt="Spending plan change"/></p><p> </p><p>If the administrator selects the When current plan expires option, the new spending plan will take effect at midnight (00:00:00) after the previous one expires. The customer’s spent amount will be reset to zero and calculated from scratch towards the new spending limit.   </p><ul data-start="1.357" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.357"><li><p>This gives administrators more flexibility for adjusting customer’s spending plans. Having the capability to change a spending plan for a customer class allows administrators to apply these changes to many customers at once, thereby reducing the administrators’ workload.</p><h3>Service usage monitoring </h3><p>Service usage monitoring allows service providers to monitor traffic sent through their networks and receive alerts whenever a toll fraud calling pattern is detected. </p><p> </p><p>For example, for the service provider who provides VoIP services mostly for the USA and Canada, an administrator can configure the PortaBilling to monitor international traffic and send alerts when an unusual burst of international traffic is detected. For the service provider who normally has lots of international traffic, the administrator can configure the service usage monitoring to receive alerts when an unusual amount of traffic is sent to premium-rate numbers.     </p></li><li><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image216.png" width="460.8" height="188.2" alt="Fraud traffic profile: service usage monitoring"/></p><p> </p><p>This allows service providers to promptly detect suspicious calling activities and take the necessary measures to mitigate potential losses.</p><h3>Fraud traffic profiles for resellers use</h3><p>Fraud traffic profiles can only be used by resellers to track their customers’ daily expenses on voice calls and notify a reseller when a customer’s spending threshold is reached. Therefore, resellers see their fraud traffic profiles as spending plans on their self-care portal.</p><p> </p><p>A reseller creates a fraud traffic profile (i.e. a spending plan) and assigns it to their customer via a customer class or directly. PortaBilling® then tracks the customer’s daily charges and once the spending limit is reached, this customer’s services are suspended.</p><p> </p><p>If a customer has used up their spending plan and wants to continue using the services, the reseller can temporarily increase their spending limit. End users can obtain more information about their spending plans on the customer self-care interface.</p><p> </p><p>For each spending plan the reseller can define warning thresholds for receiving notifications once a customer crosses their spending threshold. To enable resellers to receive notifications, the administrator enables notifications for a customer class. Then, all resellers / subresellers who are assigned this customer class are notified. </p><p> </p><p>NOTE:  An administrator does not receive notifications about reseller’s customers, and a reseller does not receive notifications about their subreseller’s customers.</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></body></html>
