Its convenient search function makes it possible to quickly find the desired record by simply inputting a key word.</p><p> </p><p>SIM cards can be added to a SIM card inventory either manually, i.e. one at a time, or can be bulk uploaded from a .csv file. Find out more about SIM card uploads and the .csv file structure in the <a href="http://www.portaone.com/resources/help/mrXX/admin/sim_card_inventory_upload.htm">PortaBilling® Help</a>. </p><p> </p><p>Once a SIM card is added to a SIM card inventory, its status is Free. This means that this SIM card is not yet assigned to any account. When a SIM card is assigned, its status is In Use. Note that a SIM card having an In Use status cannot be removed from the SIM card inventory until it is first unassigned.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image172.png" width="460.8" height="197.8" alt="SIM card inventory"/></p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image173.png" width="460.8" height="249.6" alt="Provision SIM"/></p><p> </p><p>When a SIM card is assigned to an account, it acquires the MSISDN value that equals the account ID of the linked account. Therefore, both the account and the assigned SIM card are now connected and PortaBilling® can automatically provision the information into HSS / HLR by using the External System Provisioning Framework.</p><p> </p><p>With the increasing need to manage and maintain large numbers of SIM cards and provision them into external systems, this SIM card inventory is becoming a great tool for LTE service providers and MVNOs.</p></div></body></html>
