Certain groups of customers can each be managed in their desired currency. A reseller can apply his customer’s currency (or multiple currencies) even when different from the one he uses to conduct a business with the operator (or upper-level reseller).</p><p> </p><p>Exchange rates between currencies are either entered manually by an administrator or fetched automatically from xe.com / yahoo.com.</p><h3>Obsolete currencies</h3><p>In the course of time, some currencies become obsolete (e.g. coupons). The obsolete currency cannot be added to the system or selected as a base currency. But if it was added and used in the system before becoming obsolete the system will continue working with this currency as before. </p><p>Note that when updating the list of exchange rates for existing currencies, if there are any exchange rates for obsolete currencies they will not be updated. </p></div></body></html>
