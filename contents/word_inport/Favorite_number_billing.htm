The only difference is that, in this case, the dialed number is checked against a list of “favorite” numbers defined for each account. If a match is found, the call is rated according to a special rate for the FAV destination, defined in the customer’s tariff. This allows you to offer customers a “call friends &amp; family cheaper”-type service.</p><h3>Premium number billing</h3><p>In a premium number billing model, PortaBilling® investigates (either in a local database or an external one) to determine a number’s routing destination and which rating code must be used for charging your customer.</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></body></html>
