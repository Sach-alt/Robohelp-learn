For example, let your business customers share quotas among a certain set of their accounts (e.g. grant 500 minutes of international calls for all employees in the Sales department while the Support department receives 100 minutes). To meet the customer’s request, your administrator creates a sponsor account for the Sales department, assigns a 500-minute quota to it and then creates the appropriate number of beneficiary accounts under it. Likewise, your administrator creates sponsor and beneficiary accounts for the Support department with the 100-minute shared quota assigned to the sponsor. As a result, customers optimize their service consumption and their customer experience improves.</p></div></body></html>
