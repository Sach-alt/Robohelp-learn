You can browse the xDR summary for customers, accounts, vendors, resellers and distributors.</p><p> </p><p>The xDR summary includes the following information:</p></li><li>Total number of xDRs filtered;</li><li>Totals by services;</li><li>Total sum of payments and credits;</li><li>Total sum of taxes.<p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image294.png" width="461.5" height="250.3" alt="xDR summary"/></p><p> </p><p>An administrator can download the xDRs for a specific period for further analysis, statistics purposes, etc. The output file is in the .csv format.</p><p> </p><p>The data in the xDR file differs depending on the type of entity (e.g. customer, vendor) and the selected service. An administrator can select a specific service (e.g. voice call) or download xDRs for all available services including subscriptions, payments, taxes, DID usage, etc.</p><h4>Customer xDRs </h4><p>This is an example of the output file with the customer xDRs for voice calls service:</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image295.png" width="1216.8" height="167.0" alt="The output file with the customer xDRs "/></p><p> </p><p>The following data is available:</p></li><li>Account ID</li><li>From (CLI or ANI)</li><li>To (CLD or DNIS)</li><li>Country</li><li>Description</li><li>Last hunting group</li><li>Last extension</li><li>Connect time</li><li>Disconnect time</li><li>Charged time (in hours:minutes:seconds)</li><li>Amount (USD)</li><li>Status <p>NOTE: The call duration shown in the file is based on the charged duration of the call, not the actual call duration. So if, for instance, you bill by 6-second intervals, the total call duration will be higher than the actual duration of the calls.</p><h4>Vendor xDRs </h4><p>It is very useful to have a detailed list of xDRs for a specific vendor in case of disputes over the amount of terminated traffic.</p><p> </p><p>This is an example of the output file with vendor xDRs for voice calls service:</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image296.png" width="1216.8" height="289.0" alt="The output file with the vendor xDRs "/></p><p> </p><p>The following data is available:</p></li><li>Account ID</li><li>From (CLI or ANI)</li><li>To (CLD or DNIS)</li><li>Country</li><li>Description</li><li>Connect time</li><li>Disconnect time</li><li>Disconnect reason</li><li>Charged time (in hours:minutes:seconds)</li><li>Amount (USD)</li><li>Status <h3>xDR cleanup procedure</h3><p>xDRs are stored in the Main database and replicated to the Replica database. In order to prevent system overgrowth, xDRs are periodically cleaned up. This means that a special “Cleanup” xDR exists which accumulates charged amounts and times from all xDRs that are cleaned up for each account / customer / vendor. This xDR shows up as a “Cleaned up transaction” on the xDR history page of the web interface. </p><p> </p><p>By default, the Cleanup procedure occurs during each off-peak period (every night) for all xDRs that are more than 2 months old, though these options are configurable to meet special requirements via the Configurator.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image297.png" width="460.2" height="184.3" alt="Confserv_CDR_p"/></p><p> </p><p>Although all the statistics / invoices are calculated up to the moment of the specified xDRs’ Cleanup, you can increase the period for keeping old xDRs according to your needs.</p></li></ul></div></body></html>
