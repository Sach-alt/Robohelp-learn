So while this company is presented as an independent operator to consumers, in reality it does not have any equipment of its own; the company registers its own retail customers (also called subcustomers) and individual accounts in PortaBilling®, and the billing of their end users is done there. This enables you to expand your operation by means of “white label” or “virtual operator” services. </p><p> </p><p>When a call is made by an account (end user), the reseller is billed using his own tariff (wholesale rates). Thus the end user (account+retail customer to whom it belongs) and reseller are billed separately; they may even be in different currencies. So if, for instance, a partner is reselling your services, he will pay you $0.06/min. for each call made to the US by his subscribers. At the same time, he can charge his customers any rate he wishes (e.g. $0.10/min).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Resellers can perform most everyday operations such as managing their products, changing rates to their subscribers via the self-care interface, or browsing xDR records, so there is less workload for you as an ITSP. PortaBilling® will automatically generate invoices for a reseller’s customers with his name on them, and subcustomers can go to a specific domain to access their self-care interface, where they will see the reseller’s name and logo. This ensures that the end user has an image of the reseller as an independent operator, and is not aware of your role as the ITSP.</p><p>Reseller collects money from his subcustomers and is responsible for paying invoices, issued by the PortaBilling® owner. If reseller exceeds his credit limit – this automatically blocks all activities of his subcustomers.</p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Typically used for: OEM or “white-label” service providers, companies who would like to offer the service under their own brand name, while the actual service is provided on your VoIP network and all the billing and management of their customers is done in PortaBilling®.</p><p>NOTE: Billing via the reseller model implies an additional load on the billing engine, compared to a retail customer, and using only retail customers is about 50% faster than when a reseller is involved. If performance is an issue, avoid creating resellers when it is not necessary.</p><h3>Multi-level resellers</h3><p>To reach more customers in the market many ITSPs sell their services through a multi-level network of resellers. To implement this functionality in PortaBilling®, the “carrier – reseller – end user” model has been extended to a multi-level reseller structure where the entire chain of resellers is virtually unlimited.</p><p> </p><p>Let’s assume that an ITSP engages Reseller A to sell VoIP services. Reseller A operates independently from the ITSP and is free to set his own prices for services provided. Reseller A begins to sell services to his direct clients and some small business owners thus building his own network of subresellers. Each subreseller engaged by Reseller A can act as a “white label” reseller and resell a package of services (e.g. through their own network of reselling partners) under their own brand name.  </p><p> </p><p>In this scenario, it might appear that services purchased by customer John Doe from some reseller have in fact been provided through the n-level network of resellers. Consider the example of the resellers’ network shown in the diagram below. </p><p> </p><p>The reseller’s hierarchy is modeled as follows:</p></li><li>Top-level reseller – This reseller stays at the top of the resellers’ hierarchy. He is created and managed by an administrator and deals directly with the service provider. He can create and manage his own subresellers as well as provide services directly to end users. </li><li>Subreseller – The subreseller is created and managed by a top-level reseller or another (higher-level) subreseller. Likewise the top-level reseller, the subreseller can create and manage their own (lower-level) subresellers and provide services to some end users. <p> </p><p></p><h4>Managing tariffs</h4><p>Each reseller operates with three types of tariffs: </p></li><li>Wholesale tariffs – are tariffs according to which the reseller is billed by a higher level reseller or service provider. </li><li>Resale tariffs – are tariffs that the reseller charges their subresellers. </li><li>Sales tariffs – are tariffs that the reseller charges their end users. </li></ul><p> </p><p>Wholesale tariffs are assigned to a reseller during their creation. Resale tariffs are configured as follows: when a reseller creates his subreseller, he clones the existing wholesale tariffs by applying a profit markup (a percentage) to them. Mapping between reseller’s wholesale and resale tariffs is shown on the Usage Charges tab. Sales tariffs are described in the <a href="#_Product_management">Product management</a> section below.</p><p>  <img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image72.png" width="1007.9" height="431.3" alt="Subreseller configuration"/></p><p> </p><p>Resellers can always adjust their rates for resale tariffs for specific destinations. As a rule, rates in resale tariffs are higher than those defined for wholesale rates so that the reseller creates and receives a profit each time the service is used. </p><h5>Handling a resale tariff change</h5><p>When a service provider  or reseller changes a resale tariff (for example, from tariff A to tariff B), the corresponding wholesale tariff for their subresellers also changes. </p><ul data-start="1.44" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.44"><li></li></ul></li></ul><p>For example, the reseller network includes: </p><ul data-start="96" xmlns=""><li>The service provider,</li><li>Company InterCalls, which is an authorized reseller for the service provider, and </li><li>Panda Telecom, a local Chinese community that acts as a subreseller for InterCalls. </li></ul><ul data-start="1.45" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.45"><li><p>The service provider wants to charge InterCalls using tariff A. So, an administrator chooses tariff A as the resale tariff to be applied for InterCalls. </p></li><li><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image73.png" width="461.5" height="220.2" alt="Reseller product usage charge"/></p><p> </p><p>InterCalls can see tariff A as the wholesale tariff on their self-care interface (the tariff that InterCalls is billed by the service provider). InterCalls clones this wholesale tariff (by applying a profit markup) to create a resale tariff for charging Panda Telecom. </p></li><li><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image74.png" width="993.9" height="400.9" alt="Subreseller tariff change"/></p></li><li><p>Later on, the service provider decides to charge InterCalls using tariff B. So the administrator changes resale tariff A to tariff B. </p></li><li><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image75.png" width="461.5" height="220.2" alt="Reseller tariff change"/></p></li><li></li></ul></li></ul><p>This tariff change results in the following:</p><ul data-start="99" xmlns=""><li>InterCalls can now see tariff B as their wholesale tariff. </li><li>Tariff A is no longer used for charging InterCalls and thereby does not appear on InterCalls’ self-care interface.</li><li>The resale tariff that was created by cloning tariff A remains unchanged and is still used for charging Panda Telecom. </li></ul><ul data-start="1.51" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.51"><li><p>Be aware of the following limitation: calls made by Panda Telecom’s customers that are in progress during this tariff change will not be billed. Therefore, we recommend that resale tariffs are changed only during off peak hours.</p></li><li><p>Alternatively, service providers and resellers can change the individual rates in their resale tariffs. This rate change does not affect the billing for calls that are currently in progress.      </p></li><li></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image76.png" width="993.9" height="400.9" alt="Subreseller tariff change"/></p><h4><a id="_Product_management"></a>Product management </h4><p>The product is the main tool that defines which services a reseller can offer to their end users. Resellers are not permitted to create their own products by themselves as this requires deep knowledge of the ITSP’s network structure (gateways, access lines, etc.), which most of them might not have. Instead, resellers are assigned their products from a service provider or higher-level resellers. This is done as follows: the higher-level reseller clones one of his products and the cloned product becomes ‘at the disposal’ of the lower-level reseller.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image77.png" width="1010.9" height="460.3" alt="Clone reseller product"/></p><p> </p><p>The cloned product is created with sales tariffs (i.e. tariffs according to which end users are charged). Sales tariffs, in turn, can come with or without sales rates, depending on whether the Clone Tariff Rates option was selected during the product cloning procedure. In the latter case, the reseller needs to define the appropriate rates for sales tariffs in order to sell the product.     </p><p> </p><p>With multi-level reseller functionality, ITSPs are able to easily and quickly build their own networks of resellers. This helps them increase their service offerings and gain higher profit margins.</p><h3>Callshop resellers</h3><p>A callshop is a public facility where end users come to make low-cost international or domestic calls. In a callshop, a customer is guided to enter a phone booth, makes calls and then pays for them at a cash desk. The callshop is managed by a callshop business owner who sets up the tariffs according to which end users are charged, pays for outgoing traffic and earns a profit on the margins between these costs. Callshop operators control the authorized use of booths, collect payments from customers and provide customers with receipts.   </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image78.png" width="714.6" height="842.6" alt="callshop reseller chain"/></p><p> </p><p>The following step-by-step scenario explains how a customer makes a call from a callshop and how he is then charged for it:</p><p>First, a customer is directed by a callshop operator to a specific booth.</p><ol data-start="1" xmlns=""><li>The callshop operator unlocks a booth to allow making calls from this booth.</li><li>The customer dials a desired destination number.</li><li>PortaSwitch® identifies the phone booth, keeps track of call details, and calculates the corresponding charges.</li><li>When the call session ends, the customer leaves the booth.</li><li>The operator presents the customer with a bill for the call(s) made according to rates set up by the callshop business owner. </li></ol><p> </p><p>In PortaSwitch®, a callshop business owner is configured as a callshop reseller. This type of reseller only provides callshop services to end users (any other services are not permitted to be offered). In the multi-level reseller hierarchy, the callshop reseller is usually created under a top-level reseller or a subreseller. </p><p>NOTE: To permit the creation of callshop resellers directly under service providers the Callshop option must be enabled on the Configuration server. </p><p>The callshop reseller has their own self-care interface that has been specially customized for providing callshop services.  </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image79.png" width="461.5" height="137.6" alt="Callshop reseller main menu"/></p><p> </p><p>Equipped with a wide range of features that are oriented to callshop owners and their staff, the PortaSwitch® callshop solution assists callshop network owners to easily and effectively provide reliable, high-quality and cost-effective services to their customers.</p><h3><a id="_Hlk501635257"></a>Entities for common use by the administrator and resellers</h3><p>To expand their service offerings to other spheres of business, ITSPs introduce the branded reseller program. In this program, the ITSP staff does all the service configuration and management while the resellers only deliver services to customers. This enables companies that lack deep technical knowledge to enter the telecommunications market and offer bundled solutions to customers under their name (e.g. a bank cooperates with an ITSP and resells a mobile application to their customer base).</p><p> </p><p>To begin to offer the service, each reseller must have their own set of tariffs, products, subscriptions, etc. In case of a distributed reseller chain, this imposes an additional load on the administrator. Thus, to simplify reseller management, the administrator can share their own configurations with the resellers. </p><p> </p><p>When the administrator marks the entity as shared, it becomes visible for all top-level resellers to use in their service provisioning. Since only the administrator manages the shared entity, the resellers see it as read-only. </p><p> </p><p>The list of entities to share includes the following:</p><ul data-start="1.54" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.54"><li><a href="#_Toc485211157">Products</a>,</li><li><a href="#_Hlk501526530">Tariffs</a>,</li><li><a href="#_Hlk511395481">Volume discount plans,</a> </li><li><a href="#_Toc485211180">Subscriptions</a>,</li><li><a href="#_Hlk501526639">Customer classes</a>,</li><li><a href="_Customer_Premises_Equipment"><span><span>CPE profiles,</span></span></a></li><li><a href="_Customer_Premises_Equipment">CPE.</a></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p>Of course, a reseller can also create their own entities (e.g. subscriptions, CPE profiles, customer classes) and use them along with the shared ones.</p><p> </p><p>Consider the following example: </p><p>The bank Openbank wishes to attract more premium customers. They introduce a Platinum service package that includes a personal bank officer, a premium credit card with a $100,000 limit and even a travel SIM card for discounted service usage when roaming. Then they sign a contract with EasyCall to become their reseller. </p><p> </p><p>EasyCall has several similar kinds of contracts with different companies. Therefore, EasyCall’s administrator, John Doe, configures the Triple-play product and marks it as Shared with resellers.  </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image80.png" width="461.5" height="242.6" alt="Shared product"/></p><p> </p><p>John Doe configures the reseller record for Openbank and grants them access to the system via the reseller self-care interface. Now Openbank has all the tools they need to sell services to customers and realize additional profit.</p><h4>Summary of customer types</h4><p>There are the following types of customers (all of whom have the same attributes, such as balance or address info):</p><ul data-start="102" xmlns=""><li>Reseller – Sells the service provided on your platform under his own name and product brand.</li><li>Distributor – Resells your products to end users.</li><li>Retail customer – Someone who actually uses the service.<p> </p><p>In addition, all resellers can be divided into three groups:</p></li><li>Top-level resellers – These resellers are created and managed by an administrator and do business directly with the service provider. A top-level reseller can create and manage his own subresellers and provide services directly to end users. </li><li>Subresellers – These resellers are created and managed by a top-level reseller or another (higher-level) subreseller. A subreseller can create and manage their own (lower-level) subresellers and provide services to some end users.</li><li>Callshop resellers – These resellers only provide callshop services to end users (any other services are not permitted to be offered). <p> </p><p>Distributors are subdivided into two categories:</p></li><li>Distributors – Distributors are created and managed either by administrators or by resellers and receive their commission from them. A distributor can sell products directly to end users or via its own subdistributors.</li><li>Subdistributors – Subdistributors are created and managed by distributors and receive their commission from them even though it is the service provider’s product that they sell. A subdistributor works with end users only.<p> </p><p>Customers also can be subdivided into two categories:</p></li><li>Direct customers – These are customers who communicate directly with the service provider (e.g., for account billing and payment). Direct customers can be resellers, distributors or retail customers.</li><li>Subcustomers – These are retail customers and distributors which from a PortaBilling® standpoint belong to a reseller.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Retail customers, distributors and resellers are billed according to the credit model. Their balance reflects the amount they owe you. Thus it starts from a certain value (typically 0) and goes up with each call made, or down with each refund or payment. If the customer’s balance reaches the maximum credit amount (credit limit), his accounts will not be allowed to use the service further. The only exception is a retail customer’s debit accounts: since these are prepaid, and their calls do not affect the customer’s balance, they can still make calls even if the customer has exceeded his credit limit.</p></div></body></html>
