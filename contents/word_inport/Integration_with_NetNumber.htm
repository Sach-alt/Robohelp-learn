This entails storing their DIDs in NetNumber and keeping them up-to-date. </p><p> </p><p>PortaBilling® has the ability to notify NetNumber about the creation and termination of accounts. Upon receiving a notification, NetNumber updates the corresponding DID number configuration in their database. PortaBilling® also informs NetNumber if a number has been ported-in or ported-out from the system. </p><p> </p><p>It is possible to configure whether to upload a particular account to the NetNumber database. If an end user is only subscribed to on-net services or simply does not need to receive SMS / MMS messages, by default, their account will not be uploaded to the routing database. For end users that require incoming SMS / MMS messages, a service provider purposely enables synchronization. It can be done for either the account’s product or for the account itself.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image177.png" width="461.5" height="224.0" alt="Netnumber"/></p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image178.png" width="38.4" height="38.4" alt="Wor1338"/>NOTE: The synchronization with NetNumber must be enabled on the Configuration server. To use synchronization with the NetNumber database, configure options of the NumberPorting_NetNumber group on the Configuration server web interface.</p><p>The cooperation with NetNumber ensures easy and accurate routing for SMS and MMS in North America, thereby reducing messaging transmission costs for MVNOs.</p></div></body></html>
