These are extra SIM cards that allow customers to use their service packages on multiple devices under the same subscription. </p><p> </p><p>With the twin card, customers can use the service from two phones in exactly the same way as from a single phone. With data, SIM customers can share their data packages among multiple devices, e.g. between a phone and a tablet or a car. Any service used from the extra SIM is billed to the main account. </p><p> </p><p>For twin card / data card services, use <a href="#_Hlk7085397">beneficiary accounts</a>. Consider how it works:</p><p> </p><p>John Doe is your mobile subscriber. His service bundle includes voice calls, SMS and 1GB of default data for a $20 monthly subscription. Plus, he has several top-up options for his service wallet to add more data.</p><p> </p><p>John orders an additional SIM card for his tablet and is charged $5 for SIM card activation. Your administrator creates beneficiary account 12065558882 for his main account (12065552131) and assigns a SIM card to it. Now John can make calls and use the Internet from both his phone and his tablet. </p><p> </p><p>John uses up the 1GB of default data from his tablet and wants to purchase an additional 5GB. He enters his main account’s self-care portal (12065552131) and tops up his service wallet for $10. In his transaction history, John can see that his Internet sessions from the tablet are billed to his main account (12065552131). <br/>‎</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h1><a id="_Toc31205422"></a>LTE service provisioning</h1></div></body></html>
