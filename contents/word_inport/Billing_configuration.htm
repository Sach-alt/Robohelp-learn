Note, that these parts are independent (the only common item is Destinations). So, the amount charged to your customer is unrelated to your termination expenses and vice versa.</p><h3>PortaBillingÂ® data model concept</h3><p>The illustration below shows some major elements and their interrelationships. For the sake of clarity, only the most important tables and columns are shown.</p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p></li><li>Destinations define possible phone number prefixes which will be used in the system.</li><li>Rates table stores information about rating parameters for a specific destination with a specific tariff.</li><li>Tariffs serve as a pricelist to be assigned to a specific customer or vendor</li><li>The relationship between vendors and tariffs is defined via the Connections table. A tariff assigned to a specific connection will be used to calculate termination costs for a given vendor.</li><li>Every account is assigned a certain product, which defines how the account will use the service and how it will be charged for this.</li><li>A product is related to tariffs via the rating table (Accessibility), which defines the mapping between the service consumption point (a combination of the node, access code and originating line information) and the applicable rating (service and tariff). Thus a single product may be linked with multiple tariffs. </li><li>Accounts are linked to a customer, so that a single customer can have multiple accounts.</li></ul></div></body></html>
