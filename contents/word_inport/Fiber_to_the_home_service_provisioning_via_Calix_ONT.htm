You can use them with PortaBilling® and the Calix network access equipment to deploy fiber to the home (FTTH) networks and deliver high-speed broadband Internet to your subscribers.</p><p> </p><p>GPON / AE networks consist of:</p></li><li>OLT – Optical Line Terminal – the service provider endpoint, and </li><li>ONT – Optical Network Terminal – the endpoint that is located on the customer premises. <p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image221.png" width="461.5" height="107.5" alt="GPON"/></p><p> </p><p>PortaBilling® provisions Calix ONTs such as:</p></li><li>Calix 803G GigaPoint;</li><li>Calix 844E GigaCenter;</li><li>Calix 844G / 854G GigaCenters;</li><li>Calix 716GE-I.<p>and Calix E7-20 EXA Service Access Platform for GPON / AE services.</p><p> </p><p>To make this happen, PortaBilling® has integrated with the Calix Management System (CMS). PortaBilling® provisions the following information to the CMS via the External Systems Provisioning Framework (ESPF):</p></li><li>ONT data such as the FSAN serial number – e.g. the unique serial number of the equipment, and</li><li>account and service configuration data, e.g. the account status, Calix bandwidth profile ID within the Internet access policy, etc.<p> </p><p>Thus, Calix performs network access and configuration management while PortaBilling® operates as a B/OSS by providing a single place to perform customer and service management. </p><p> </p><p>When the administrator assigns the ONT to a user’s account from the CPE inventory in PortaBilling®, PortaBilling® sends the provisioning request to the CMS. The CMS activates the service for the user on the ONT and allocates the bandwidth as defined in the bandwidth profile.  The user can now access the service. </p><p> </p><p>When a user does not pay for their service (e.g. has insufficient funds to cover the monthly subscription fees), PortaBilling® instructs the CMS to suspend their services on the ONT until a payment is received. If the user upgrades to a new package (e.g. from 5Mbps to 20Mbps), PortaBilling® provisions the service configuration change to the CMS. The CMS allocates the new bandwidth limits on the ONT and the user receives the benefit of faster speed.</p><p> </p><p>To configure the Calix ONT provisioning, do the following:</p></li><li>Configure the Calix Management System by creating network uplinks for GPON services, ONT and Ethernet bandwidth profiles, etc. (Please find configuration details on the <a href="https://www.calix.com/content/calix/en/site-prod/library-html/systems-products/e-series/sysop/e7-ud/r2-5/gpon-ag/index.htm">Calix</a> website.).</li><li>Upload ONT devices to the CPE inventory;</li><li>Configure the Internet Access policy and specify the Ethernet bandwidth profile ID within.</li><li>Configure the Internet access service in PortaBilling®. </li><li>Configure the ESPF in PortaBilling to enable data provisioning to CMS.<p> </p><p>This solution enables you to build cost-effective last mile networks that work with gigabit speeds and thus meet users’ increasing demands for more bandwidth. You automate the service configuration and the delivery to your users as well as its availability, based on their demands (e.g. the decision to upgrade), and their billing status (e.g. suspended upon non-payment). </p></li></ul></li></ul></div></body></html>
