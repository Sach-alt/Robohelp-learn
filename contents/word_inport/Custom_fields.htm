This can be information about a customer’s bonus, driving license ID, or a code name that maps an Internet customer to a certain vendor, etc. This can also be very useful for troubleshooting. Create your own custom fields and give them whatever name you like, set a field type and then control their visibility, etc. </p><p> </p><p>Custom fields are treated like any other field; you can organize them via customer classes and fine-tune their visibility for end users. Then desired custom fields can be set on the Customer / Account Info page and used for search queries.  </p><p> </p><p>Custom fields are added to Invoice templates under the Header section and it is possible, as well, to add custom fields in Layout Designer (right-click<span></span>Header).</p><p> </p><p>This functionality allows you to manage extra user information that in its turn facilitates customer support and helps with troubleshooting.</p></div></body></html>
