The invoice due date is calculated as invoice_issue_date + grace period. For example, if the issue date is June 1 and the grace period is 15, the invoice must be paid before June 16. The grace period can be zero, in which case the invoice is considered to be due upon receipt.</li><li>Suspension time defines within how many days the customer will be suspended after an invoice becomes overdue. Suspension means that, while the customer’s information will remain intact, he will not be able to use certain services, most notably sending or receiving calls.</li><li>Closing time defines within how many days a customer account will be closed after an invoice becomes overdue. </li></ul><p> </p><p>Let’s take a look at the following example. Customer A has a grace period of 21 days, a suspension time of 14 days, and a closing time of 21 days. A’s invoice was generated on May 1st, so that the invoice due date is May 22nd. If A does not pay by that date, the invoice will become overdue; 14 days (2 weeks) after that – on June 5th – his account will be suspended; and on June 12th – 21 days after the due date, or one week after the suspension date – his account will be permanently closed.</p><h3><a id="_Hlk28619801"></a>Automated payment collection</h3><p>You can automate customers’ invoice payments by charging their credit cards. This saves customers’ time and prevents having their service suspended since their invoices are always paid automatically and on time.</p><p> </p><p>You can charge customers’ credit cards either immediately upon invoice generation or on their due date.</p><h4>Upon invoice generation</h4><p>When a customer’s billing period closes, PortaBilling® calculates their charges, creates their invoice and charges their credit card. After successful payment processing, PortaBilling® generates their .pdf invoice file with a zero amount due and the Paid in full status.</p><h4>Upon invoice due date</h4><p>In this case, PortaBilling® generates the invoice .pdf file and sends it to the customer. During the specified grace period, the invoice remains unpaid. On the due date, PortaBilling® charges the customer’s credit card for the complete invoice amount. </p><ul data-start="1.446" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.446"><li><p>A customer can pay for an invoice earlier, either partially or in full. If the payment is partial, PortaBilling® charges the customer’s credit card for the remaining amount on the due date. </p><p> </p><p>To have a closer look at how customers are charged on their invoice due date, consider these examples:</p><h5>Regular invoices</h5><p>EasyCall pays their invoices 30 days after its issue. </p><p> </p><p>On February 1, EasyCall receives their January invoice with $100 due and the due date for this invoice is March 2. EasyCall uses the service for the whole of February and receives a new invoice with $80 due on March 1. On March 2, PortaBilling® charges their credit card for $100 to cover the January invoice and on March 31, PortaBilling® charges them for $80, as that is the due date for their February invoice. </p><h5>Out-of-turn invoices</h5><p>You can collect delayed payments for out-of-turn invoices, too. The grace period for out-of-turn invoices is 10 days. On June 10, EasyCall receives an out-of-turn invoice for their equipment rental. On June 20, PortaBilling® charges their credit card for the invoice amount. </p><h5>Re-collection attempts</h5><p>If an initial payment is unsuccessful for some reason, PortaBilling® can try to charge the customer’s credit card again (refer to the Re-collection attempts section for details).</p><p> </p><p>Let’s say you have configured a re-collection attempt for 20 days after the due date. On April 1, EasyCall receives their invoice for March 1-31 with an amount due of $100. This invoice’s due date is May 1. PortaBilling® charges the customer’s credit card for $100 but the payment fails so the invoice becomes overdue. On May 1, EasyCall receives a new invoice for April 1-30 with a $150 amount due.</p><p> </p><p>Then on May 21, 20 days after the March invoice due date, PortaBilling® again charges the credit card for $100. The payment fails again so the invoice remains overdue. </p><p> </p><p>May 31 is the due date for the April invoice. The total outstanding balance is now $250, since it includes the previous balance for the March invoice ($100) and the April invoice’s one ($150). This time, PortaBilling® charges the credit card for $250 and since the payment is successful, both invoices become Paid in full.</p><p> </p><p>To automatically charge customers’ credit cards for invoice amounts:</p></li><li>Configure a payment system in PortaBilling®;</li><li>Enable the Automatic credit card charge option for the customer class; </li><li>Specify what the grace period is and for how many days after the invoice due date re-collection attempts will be made;</li><li>Make sure customer’s credit card details are saved in PortaBilling® and activate automatic charging for invoices.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Collection threshold</h4><p>In case a customer has not actively used the service and his invoice amount is very low, (e.g. less than $1) it does not really make sense to follow the normal collection process and request payment for that amount.</p><p> </p><p>So if the amount due on a new invoice is lower than the specified threshold – no payment is yet required. If no payment is made, the balance is applied to the next invoice, etc. until the amount due on a new invoice crosses that threshold. When full payment is made for these outstanding invoices, it will be applied to all the open invoices and then they will be considered paid.</p><h4>Notifications regarding payment due</h4><p>Since it may happen that a customer has lost or overlooked the original invoice, PortaBilling® can send automated notifications to a customer several times before the invoice due date, stating that payment has still not been received. You can configure any set of days, e.g. “10,7,1” will send notifications 10 days, 7 days and 1 day prior to the invoice due date.</p><h4>Overdue invoice notifications</h4><p>When an invoice is past its due date, PortaBilling® will continue notification attempts, but in this case using a different notification text. Here again, you have complete freedom in configuring this notification policy: for instance, “0,7,14” will send an alert to the customer on the due date, and then 7 and 14 days later.</p><h4>Re-collection attempts</h4><p>It could be that the initial attempt to charge a customer’s credit card has failed due to a temporary problem (e.g. he exceeded his credit limit, having recently made a very expensive purchase, but has now paid his credit card bill). In such a case, it would be useful to try charging his card sometime later. However, since the merchant bank will usually charge you for every failed credit card transaction, this should not be done too often.</p><p> </p><p>In the customer class definition you can specify when re-collect attempts should be made, e.g. “0,3,7” means that PortaBilling® will attempt to charge the customer’s credit card on the due date, 3 days after the due date, and 7 days after the due date.</p><h4>Suspension warning time</h4><p>As a last resort to prevent service interruption, PortaBilling® will send another alert to the customer prior to service suspension. This parameter may also be configured in the customer class definition.</p><h4>Closing warning time</h4><p>In the case that an invoice is not paid in full after service suspension, a reminder notification will be sent to the customer stating that his account is about to be permanently closed. </p><h4>Customer account during collection</h4><p>When a customer has an unpaid or overdue invoice, all call services are rendered as usual, subscription fees are charged for the current period, and new invoices are generated (for instance, if your customer has net payment terms of 60 days, he may have two other (newer) invoices generated by the time his invoice becomes overdue).</p><p> </p><p>When a customer has suspended status, his call services are blocked, but some subscription fees are still applied (since his account is being provisioned, e.g. his voicemail is kept on the server).</p><p> </p><p>When the customer’s account is closed, no further activities, be it calls, subscription fees, self-care access, or any other, are available for his account.</p><h4>Collection process</h4><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><ul data-start="372" xmlns=""><li>At the end of the billing period an invoice is generated (1).</li><li>If the invoice has a positive amount due, it is considered unpaid. When the invoice status is unpaid, a customer may be reminded of the approaching due date (2).</li><li>On the due date, the unpaid invoice becomes overdue (3).</li><li>Several collection attempts may be made (attempts to charge the customer’s credit card on file for the amount due) (4).</li><li>The customer may be reminded that the invoice is overdue (5) and that service may soon be suspended (6).</li><li>On the suspension date, the customer’s status changes to suspended (7), which automatically blocks his access to services.</li><li>If the payment issue is not resolved, the customer’s account is closed on the closing date (8).<p> </p><p>In some cases, after the customer is suspended, and thus finally realizes that there is an unpaid invoice(!), he needs some extra time to submit payment. In this case, his suspended status may be temporary lifted by the administrator. The administrator will revert the customer’s status to normal and specify the date until which suspension is postponed. If the invoice is not paid in full by that date, the customer will be automatically suspended again.</p><h3>Void invoices</h3><p>It sometimes happens that an error is detected after an invoice has been generated and delivered to the customer. A new invoice must be produced, but the old one must be kept for audit purposes. The void invoice operation marks the invoice as canceled (this will also be visible in the .pdf file), and then a new invoice is automatically produced.</p><h3>Invoice recalculation </h3><p>This process voids an existing invoice and generates a new one in its place. </p><h3>Invoices review</h3><p>In order to provide your customers with correct invoices, PortaBilling® allows you to review invoices before sending them to your customers. The administrator reviews the invoices and then approves them, or if necessary, performs balance adjustments (for example, to correct an invoice total) or sends them to be regenerated (if, for example, the administrator has additional reasons to update the invoice). Only after that step the invoices are delivered via email to your customers.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image232.png" width="461.5" height="102.4" alt="Invoices list"/></p><p> </p><p>This functionality can be used for the following situations:</p></li><li>Billing of premium customers – If you have premium customers you naturally want to provide them with high quality services. The invoices are no exception. You want to make sure that all charges are included and that the invoice total is calculated correctly.</li><li>Billing of a new service – An administrator creates a new service with new ratings, tariffs, products and invoice templates. If he is not sure whether all the new charges are correctly calculated he can activate the “send invoice after review and approval by administrator” option for a specific customer class. At the end of the billing period the invoices are created and marked as “needs review,” but are not yet sent to customers and not available for download from the web interface. Only after the administrator checks and approves the invoices they are delivered to customers via email.</li><li>Changes in templates – If during invoice review an administrator discovers that a template must be adjusted, he changes the template. Then on the Invoices Review page he selects all of the “under review” invoices that were created using this template and regenerates new ones. Then they are sent for a second review.</li></ul><p> </p><p>If the “auto-charge credit card” functionality is enabled together with the “review invoices” functionality, then the credit card will be charged after the administrator’s approval of the invoice.</p><p> </p><p>To prevent situations where invoice review has not been performed there is an additional field that defines how many days the invoices remain under review before they are auto-approved by PortaBilling®. Each day administrators, who belong to the corresponding mailing list, receive an email with a list of all the invoices to be reviewed. If an invoice is not reviewed by the end of the specified period, it is automatically approved and sent to the customer. An email with a list of all auto-approved invoices is sent to the administrators who belong to the corresponding mailing list.</p><h4>Back-dated charges for invoices under review</h4><p>When an administrator reviews invoices he can apply balance adjustments to be included on the current invoice. He specifies the amount and the date of the balance adjustment that is covered by the most recent billing period. </p><p><br/>‎<span>Consider the following example:</span></p><p>The administrator reviews invoice #123 for March 2015 with an invoice total of $150, notices a human error (a $100 subscription is charged, but it should have been free this month according to the agreement). He can click the Refund button and apply a $100 credit to the customer. The invoice is then automatically scheduled for recalculation / regeneration. After that, the invoice shows a credit of $100 and the total is changed according to this transaction. As a result, the invoice total is $50.</p></div></body></html>
