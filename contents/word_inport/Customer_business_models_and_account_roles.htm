In addition, the Universal business model is also used for backward compatibility – any previously created customer is automatically assigned the Universal business model after a software upgrade. </p><p> </p><p>An administrator assigns a business model via a customer class. </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image66.png" width="460.8" height="236.8" alt="Customer business model"/></p><p> </p><p>Depending on the chosen business model, the administrator is offered a list of recommended account roles for it.</p><h4>Account role</h4><p>An account role defines what a specific account is designated for (e.g. whether the account represents a phone line or a top-up voucher) and executes account ID validation. Thus, for a phone line, one can only pick a valid phone number as an account ID.</p><p> </p><p>The following table demonstrates which account roles are available for each business model:</p><p> </p><div align="left"><table border="1.3" cellspacing="0"><colgroup xmlns=""><col style="width:132px"/><col style="width:336px"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>Business model</p></td><td><p>Account roles</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Universal</p></td><td><p>All available account roles.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hosted IP PBX</p></td><td><p>Phone line, Auto attendant. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SIP trunking</p></td><td><p>Phone line, IPv4 address.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Residential VoIP</p></td><td><p>Phone line, Auto attendant, Voucher.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PINless</p></td><td><p>PINless.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Internet access</p></td><td><p>User@domain, Voucher.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Prepaid card holder</p></td><td><p>Prepaid card, PINless, Voucher.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mobile</p></td><td><p>Mobile, Voucher.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image67.png" width="460.8" height="236.8" alt="Account roles"/></p><p> </p><p>The administrator defines account roles for both accounts and products. This introduces the following constraint – a product can only be assigned to an account having the same role. </p><p> </p><p>This makes it possible to reduce the occurrence of errors during product assignment. For example, an account that is supposed to be for a phone line can only be assigned to a product that is designated for that; i.e. one cannot mistakenly pick a business SIP trunk product. The administrator can change an account role if required. </p><p> </p><p>Along with an account role, an administrator can define an account realm. </p><h4>Account realm </h4><p>An account realm allows administrators to impose a scope of uniqueness for an account ID. An account realm is configured for a product. </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image68.png" width="460.8" height="236.8" alt="Account realms"/></p><p> </p><p>For example, user John Doe wants to subscribe to the SmartCall product for PINless dialing from their mobile phone 12065551234. To provision John Doe’s mobile phone in PortaBilling®, the administrator configures the SmartCall product using an ani realm. The administrator adds an account and chooses the SmartCall product for it. Then the account is saved in the following format: 12065551234@ani. </p><p> </p><p>John Doe finds another PINless dialing product attractive, MegaCall, and wants to subscribe to it too. The administrator needs to add an account that must not be confused with the account for the SmartCall product. The account realm perfectly serves this purpose. The administrator configures the MegaCall product with subrealm1.ani realm. The administrator adds an account and chooses the MegaCall product for it. The account is saved in the following format: 12065551234@subrealm1.ani. </p><p> </p><p>This allows proper provisioning for both accounts in PortaBilling®.</p><h4>Alias role and realm</h4><p>When an administrator adds an alias to an account, a role and realm must be selected for it. Alias role and realm selection is limited by the main and add-on products assigned to the account. </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image69.png" width="460.8" height="173.5" alt="Alias role and realm"/></p><p>NOTE: The Auto attendant and Voucher roles are not supported for account aliases.  </p><p>The introduction of the business model and account role concept ensures that:</p><ul data-start="1.41" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.41"><li>The correct account ID format is preserved during account creation; and   </li><li>The chances of assigning an incorrect product to an account are significantly reduced.</li><li></li></ul></li></ul><p>This makes the account creation procedure more user-friendly and reduces the occurrence of human error.</p></div></body></html>
