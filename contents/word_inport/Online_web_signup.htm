A template-based API for online signup allows you to customize page layout and put a web signup front-end on multiple websites (web portals, web pages of your resellers or affiliates, etc.). The following diagram illustrates the online web signup process:</p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>A fully functional web signup portal is supplied with PortaBilling®. You can use it out of the box, or take it as the basis for further customizations.</p><p> </p><p>Web signup allows you to:</p><ul data-start="434" xmlns=""><li>Collect customer name and address information.</li><li>Allow customers to select from the available phone numbers.</li><li>Choose a desired product bundle.</li><li>Collect a customer’s credit card information.</li><li>Authorize credit card payments made via payment systems that don’t require external authorization, fully provision the account information in PortaBilling®, and provide service-related information (e.g. auto-configuration file for a softphone).<p> </p><p>This is a three-level application which allows you to deploy multiple online web signup sites without compromising security, and to easily customize each site to fit a specific business case.</p></li><li>Front-end – These are the web pages customers will access using their web browser.
