It allows you to utilize all the benefits of LTE: quick user connectivity, better service quality and higher performance, etc. It also helps to ensure a better LTE experience for your customers by allowing them to use their favorite data and voice applications simultaneously. </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>To deploy VoLTE services with PortaBilling® as the online-charging system (OCS), PortaBilling® supports the Diameter (Ro) interface. Thus, PortaBilling® communicates with IMS via Diameter (Ro) for real-time user authorization and charging. When a user runs out of funds or exceeds their credit limit, PortaBilling® instructs the node to disconnect the user, thereby preventing revenue leakage.</p><p> </p><p>PortaBilling supports processing of calls to ported numbers in IMS networks in the same way as in VoIP networks. See more in the <a href="#_Hlk535832335">Local number portability</a> section.</p><p> </p><p>By performing the functions of an OCS, PortaBilling® manages the customer balance and service configuration (service policies, quotas, etc.) that are provisioned to other components on the LTE network.</p><h3>Supported features</h3><p>In conclusion, the list of features available in PortaBilling® and provisioned via the Diameter protocol can be divided into the following categories:</p></li><li>General features for both Diameter (Gy) and (Ro) interfaces,</li><li>Features provisioned via Diameter (Gy) and</li><li>Features provisioned via Diameter (Ro).<h5>General features</h5></li><li>Online Centralized Session charging with units reservation (SCUR) and Credit-control application (DCCA).</li><li>Charging based on the time of use (peak / off peak).<h5>Features provisioned via Diameter (Gy)</h5></li><li>Traffic categorization into rating groups.</li><li>Hotlining.</li><li>Server-initiated credit re-authorization (RAR) to lift service restrictions from an account upon account top-up. It is triggered by ESPF events.</li><li>Additional AVPs (Volume-Quota-Threshold, Time-Quota-Threshold, Quota-Consumption-Time, Quota-Holding-Time, Multiple-Services-Credit-Control).<h5>Features provisioned via Diameter (Ro):</h5></li><li>Online Centralized Event (SMS) charging with units reservation (ECUR). </li><li>Voice calls charging (e.g. outgoing off-net / on net calls, incoming calls).</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p>With further PortaBilling® interconnection with the mobile network, this list will be extended with other features in upcoming releases.</p><p> </p><p>Please find Diameter supported RFCs and PortaBilling® communication diagrams in the <a href="#_Appendices">Appendices </a>section.</p></div></body></html>
