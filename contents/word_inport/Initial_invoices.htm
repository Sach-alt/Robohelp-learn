Initial invoice improves client service by saving customers’ time while providing you with a tool for generating early payments. </p><p>NOTE: A subscription can be included in the initial invoice only if its Subscription Charges Applied option is set to In Advance.</p><p>Consider the following example. The SpaceNet company signs a contract with a service provider and orders several IP phones for their employees. The service provider generates and sends an initial invoice, wherein all charges are immediately applied and calculated. SpaceNet receives this initial invoice and can now pay for all the IP phones they ordered. Thus, SpaceNet saves time by considering their future needs while the service provider benefits by immediately receiving their money. </p><p> </p><p>The initial invoice tool is efficient as it optimizes the subscription process for new customers and improves the service provider’s cash-flow.</p></div></body></html>
