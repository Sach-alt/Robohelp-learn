The difference between this and “Manual Credit” is that this transaction applies to a special “Credits / Promotions” service, and not to any actual service.

Administrators can reduce the amount a customer must pay for an invoice without regenerating the invoice. To do this, the administrator just enters the waived amount for the invoice. The customer pays only the balance to cover the invoice in full.   </p><p>  <img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image235.png" width="461.7" height="193.8" alt="Adjust invoice "/></p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image236.png" width="727.3" height="457.4" alt="adjustment setup"/></p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image237.png" width="460.8" height="89.5" alt="adjusted balance"/></p><p> </p><p>The adjustment operation does not change any invoice data (or what’s on the .pdf file). If an adjustment is made to an invoice issued several billing periods ago, all subsequent invoices are also left unchanged. The adjustment transaction(s) is only reflected in the invoice for the current billing period.  </p><p> </p><p>Consider the following example. A customer’s billing period is monthly. On March 1st, an invoice for February for $1000 is generated and on April 1st, a March invoice for $500 is generated. Later in April, the customer disputes some of the charges from his February invoice and is given a waiver for $50. The administrator enters the waived amount and therefore the customer pays $1450. Now his February and March invoices are paid.  </p><p> </p><p>These transactions will be reflected in his April invoice: </p><ul data-start="382" xmlns=""><li>Previous Balance – $1500.</li><li>Invoice Adjustment – $50.</li><li>Payment  – $1450.</li></ul><p> </p><p>With outstanding balance adjustment functionality, ITSPs easily deal with invoices requiring offsets. Additionally, the workload for the accounting department is reduced since activities related to invoice regeneration (i.e. resending invoices, etc.) do not have to be performed. </p><h3>Adjustment for paid invoices</h3><p>Administrators can also adjust invoices with a Paid status that have already been paid by customers (e.g. automatically by credit card). In this case the adjustment transaction is a refund which is applied to the customer’s balance.</p><p> </p><p>When adjusting a paid invoice, an administrator can select how to apply a refund to the customer: either to the customer’s balance as an unallocated fund or to their credit card, if that has been configured for the customer.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image238.png" width="460.4" height="193.8" alt="paid invoice adjutment options"/></p><p> </p><p>A refund that is issued for a customer’s current billing period appears as an unallocated payment and is included in their forthcoming invoice. </p><p> </p><p>If a refund to a credit card is unsuccessful for some reason, the refund is added to the customer’s unallocated payments and is used for paying their following invoice. </p><p> </p><p>This capability to adjust paid invoices improves the claims settlement process, thus increasing the customer’s overall experience.</p></div></body></html>
