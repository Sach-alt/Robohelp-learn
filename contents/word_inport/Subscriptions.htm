If your advertisement states something like “only $9.99 per month, and just $0.99 extra per month for Voicemail service,” then two subscription plans are involved. The parameters you specify within a subscription plan affect the customer balance. Each subscription plan includes the following:</p><ul data-start="209" xmlns=""><li>Name and description – Your administrators use this to better manage various subscription plans.</li><li>Subscription plan name visible to end user – This is a clear subscription name that is shown to end users on invoices and on their self-care interfaces.</li><li>Activation mode – This specifies when a subscription is active and when charges start. A subscription is typically activated upon its creation (or on the start date, if that is specified). PortaBilling® supports an additional mode of subscription activation based on the account’s first use. You can avoid issues when there is a delay between the time a customer signs up for a service and the time they can actually use it (e.g. the customer uses online signup to purchase a residential SIP service, but their IP phone is not delivered by FedEx until five days later).</li><li>Minimum subscription period and early cancellation penalty – It is common practice to lock a customer’s contract for a certain period (e.g. if you provide the customer with a free IP phone, you want to make sure they continue paying monthly fees until the cost of the phone is paid back). If the subscription service is canceled earlier than the interval specified, the customer is charged a cancellation penalty.</li><li>Subscription fees – These are the charges applied while the customer has an active subscription; see below for more details.</li></ul><h3>Subscription fees</h3><p>When a customer’s billing period closes, PortaBilling® calculates the charges for any subscriptions that were active during this period. For each subscription, there are three types of charges:</p><ul data-start="1.143" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.143"><li>Activation fee</li><li>Cancellation fee </li><li>Periodic fee<h4>Activation fee </h4><p>An activation fee automatically applies when a subscription start time begins, with one exception. Namely, in the subscription plan’s properties you may specify that the subscription plan will be active only when the account is used for the first time. In this case, the subscription is activated either on its start date or on the date of the account’s first use, whichever comes later.</p><h4>Cancellation fee </h4><p>A subscription which is not yet active can simply be deleted (for instance, a customer signs up for a new service beginning next month, but then changes his mind). A subscription that is already active cannot be deleted (see the <a href="#_Assigning_subscriptions">Assigning subscriptions</a> section for details). When a subscription is canceled, the cancellation date is entered as the finish date for the subscription and the customer is charged a cancellation penalty. </p><p> </p><p>The cancellation date is typically the day on which cancellation takes place. However, you can also schedule cancellation for a future date (e.g. a customer wishes to use the service until the end of the present month)..  </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image115.png" width="462.1" height="286.1" alt="Finish date"/></p><p> </p><p>The record of the canceled subscription allows PortaBilling® to correctly charge for closed subscriptions. For example, if a customer subscribes to the service on the 3rd and cancels it on the 7th, he is still charged for five days of service.</p><p> </p><p>You can define the cancellation penalty as either a fixed amount or the remaining subscription charge. In the latter case, if the customer’s $5 subscription must be active for 10 months but they cancel it in six months, the customer’s cancellation penalty is $20, which is the sum of charges for the remaining four months.</p><p> </p><p>Note that if you change the subscription fee (e.g. from $5 to $7) before a customer cancels their subscription, PortaBilling® uses the new fee to charge the cancellation penalty. Thus, a customer from the example above is charged $28 ($7 * 4 months) as a cancellation penalty.</p><h4>Periodic fee  </h4><p>A periodic fee defines the recurring charges applied to a customer for service usage. Periodic subscription fees are pro-rated depending on the actual duration of the service used. </p><p> </p><p>The following examples relate to the same subscription plan with a monthly periodic fee of $9.99 and illustrate how it is pro-rated:</p></li><li>Customer A, with a monthly billing period, activates the subscription on April 12th. On May 1st the customer is charged $6.33 because they use the service for 19 days (12-30) and ($9.99/30) * 19 = $6.33).</li><li>Customer B, also with a monthly billing period, activates the subscription on April 12th and cancels it on the 25th. On May 1st the customer is charged $4.66 because they use the service for 14 days (12- 25) and ($9.99/30) * 14 = $4.66.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p>These types of subscription fees are reflected on the invoice as extra invoice lines.</p><p> </p><p>You can modify the periodic fee for a subscription plan once it has been activated (e.g. you can decide to increase / decrease the price for a service). </p><p> </p><p>In this case, fee changes have no influence on the current billing period and are applied to the next billing period. In other words, there is no recalculation. The next billing period’s charges use the newly modified periodic fees. </p><p> </p><p>For example, if a subscription fee of $10 is charged one month in advance and the current monthly billing period ends on April 10th, the customer is charged until May 10th. </p><p> </p><p>On April 25th the subscription fee changes and becomes $8. The customer’s invoice (produced on April 11th) contains charges for all calls made prior to April 10th and subscription charges covering the period from April 11th to May 10th without any recalculation (i.e. the subscription charges are still $10 for this billing period despite any changes). </p><p> </p><p>The new subscription fee ($8) is applied to the new billing period, which covers the period from May 11th to June 10th, and the customer continues being charged $8 for subsequent billing periods.</p><h3>Periodic fees configuration </h3><p>Since your customers may have different billing periods, PortaBilling® provides you with the flexibility to individually assign subscription costs for each period. For instance, if your monthly rate is $19.99, you may want to charge a higher weekly rate than $4.99, since the maintenance required by customers with shorter billing periods increases, and justifies a higher rate. </p><p> </p><p>For instance, PortaBilling® allows you to define your monthly rate as $19.99, your semimonthly rate as $10.99, your weekly rate as $6.99 and daily rate as $1.99 for the exact same subscription plan. PortaBilling® will automatically use the correct base value according to the customer’s billing period.</p><h4>Promotional periods</h4><p>Yet another common business practice is to offer special rates for an initial period following signup (e.g. “Only $9.99/month!”) while the disclaimer states: “For the first six months only, after which the standard rate of $29.99 / month applies.” PortaBilling® allows you to define an unlimited number of promotional periods, with different subscription fees for each. For example, you could create a subscription that offers free service for the first three months, a rate of $9.99 for the next nine months, and $12.99 thereafter; or something even more complex.</p><h4>Incompletely used promotional periods</h4><p>A subscription’s promotional period includes each billing period during which a service is used, regardless of how many days the service is used in a particular billing period.</p><p> </p><p>For example, let’s say you offer a promotional period for three months and your customer John Doe subscribes to it on July 15th. John Doe is charged for the second half of July (16 days) and for the following two months (August and September) according to the promotional rate. Starting from the fourth month (October), the default rate is used.</p><p> </p><p>In order to avoid potential misunderstandings when a customer expects a longer promotional period (till October 15th from the example above), the best practice is to use an anniversary billing cycle, as this eliminates the problem of “incompletely used” promotional periods.</p><h3>Applying subscriptions</h3><p>Since a product defines the way you provide a service to an end user, and subscriptions define charges for this service, it is obvious that they must be interconnected. That’s why subscriptions are usually included with products (they can be selected from the subscription list.) To define a flat rate for provided service(s) and avoid discrepancies between subscription plans with different configuration parameters, only one subscription plan per product (both main and add-on ones) is allowed.</p><p> </p><p>Subscriptions that an account receives with the products requested are called obligatory subscriptions, because it is not possible to remove or cancel these subscriptions as long as the account uses these products. You may, however, add optional subscriptions to an account (e.g. if an EasyCall product user wishes to receive Voicemail service). These optional subscriptions can be added or canceled as you wish. Note that you can only apply the same subscription once to an account if it has not been explicitly defined in its configuration (see the <a href="#_Hlk462997179">Multiple subscriptions</a> section for details).</p><p> </p><p>You can also assign subscriptions to a specific customer. Here the procedure is exactly the same as with an account. Since a customer cannot have a product assigned directly to him, there are no obligatory subscriptions in this case, i.e. all of a customer’s subscriptions are optional.</p><h4>Add-on product subscriptions</h4><p>Both a feature and a subscription are attached to add-on products, so an administrator must only assign an add-on product to an account. Once the feature is activated, the customer is automatically charged for it.</p><p> </p><p>For example, a customer is assigned the “Call Waiting” add-on product with the call waiting feature enabled and a subscription associated with it that applies recurring charges for its usage. If the customer no longer needs call waiting functionality, the administrator removes the add-on product from the account properties with a single mouse click.   </p><h4><a id="_Hlk462997179"></a>Multiple subscriptions</h4><p>In most cases, every single subscription is charged only once even if this subscription is included in with several add-on products assigned to the account.</p><p> </p><p>But in some cases it is necessary to assign the same subscription multiple times.</p><p> </p><p>Let’s have a look at the following example. One of your customers is assigned a subscription for renting a router from you. On another day, they want to rent a second router and must therefore be charged the same subscription twice: for the (first) already rented router and for the newly rented one. Since this customer’s account already has a subscription for renting a router, a new add-on product is created with the same subscription assigned for the rent of the second router.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image116.png" width="460.8" height="286.1" alt="Multiple subscriptions"/></p><p> </p><p>To make this happen, the administrator enables the “Apply more than once” option within the subscription plan configuration. This makes it possible to assign the same subscription to one account multiple times.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image117.png" width="460.8" height="370.0" alt="Multiple subscription"/></p><p> </p><p>This model of applying subscriptions makes it possible to:</p><ul data-start="214" xmlns=""><li>provide revenue assurance, because using an add-on product guarantees that the feature will be activated, and the customer automatically charged for it; and</li><li>save time, because everything can be done in one place using an add-on product.<h4>Changing the subscription plan for a product</h4><p>You may change the subscription plan for a given product at any time. This, however, affects all existing accounts that have this product. Once you select a new subscription plan for a product, the change takes immediate effect: the old subscription plan is removed and the new one is applied to all accounts with this product assigned..</p><h4>Changing an account’s product and subscriptions</h4><p>A change of product for an existing account, e.g. from product A to B, will have the following effect on this account’s subscriptions:</p></li><li>The obligatory subscription plan (inherited by the account from product A) changes to the subscription plan assigned to product B.</li><li>Optional subscriptions (assigned to the account directly) remain unchanged.</li></ul><h3>Ways to charge for subscriptions </h3><h4>Traditional method</h4><p>This is a very common and widely popular method. When a customer’s billing period closes, PortaBilling® calculates the applicable charges for all subscriptions that were active during that period and applies them to the customer’s balance.</p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Consequently, once the billing period is closed there may be a significant increase in the customer’s balance.</p><h4>Progressive method</h4><p>While the situation described above is acceptable for postpaid customers with a large credit limit, or if a customer has a credit card that is automatically charged when a billing period is closed, it may create certain problems for prepaid customers. If such a customer does not have sufficient available funds at the end of the billing period, his balance will exceed the credit limit and his outgoing calls may be blocked. PortaBilling® provides a solution to this problem by allowing you to conveniently offer prepaid VoIP services in combination with subscription fees.</p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>To avoid the unpleasant situation of a sizeable charge at the end of the billing period, PortaBilling®’s progressive charges are continuously applied. This means that at any given moment in time, the charged amount will cover the interval from the beginning of the billing period until the current day. For example, a customer with a monthly billing period signs up for a subscription with a $9.99 monthly fee on April 1st. This means that every day of the billing period the customer is charged $9.99 / 30 = $0.33. By the end of the billing period the total charged amount is equal to $9.99. In effect, the customer is charged small portions of the full fee every day. His balance grows slowly, giving him enough time to act in response and deposit more money into his account.</p><h4>Subscriptions charged in advance</h4><p>This mode of charging allows service providers to charge customers for one or more billing periods in the future. PortaBilling® applies ‘in advance’ charges for the following period at the end of the current billing period. </p><p> </p><p>Let’s say that your postpaid customer John Doe wants to rent an IP phone from you. You want John to pay for the phone rental in advance so you assign a subscription plan that is $30 with a $10 activation fee, charged one month in advance.  </p><p> </p><p>Once a subscription plan is activated, PortaBilling® immediately applies the subscription charges for the current billing period. At the end of the billing period, PortaBilling® applies the following month’s charges in advance and adds them to the customer’s invoice. </p><p> </p><p>So if you assign a subscription plan to John on April 1st, PortaBilling® immediately applies both the $10 activation fee and the $30 periodic fee to John’s balance. </p><p> </p><p>At the end of April, PortaBilling® calculates all of John’s usage charges for the current billing period (April) and applies the following month’s subscription charges in advance (May). Thus, on May 1st John receives his invoice and sees charges for calls made in April plus the subscription charge for $70 that covers:</p><ul data-start="1.148" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.148"><li>the $10 activation fee,</li><li>the $30 periodic fee from April 1st to April 30th and </li><li>the $30 periodic fee from May 1st to May 31st. <p> </p><p>On June 1st John receives his invoice and sees charges for calls made in May plus the $30 subscription charge that covers from June 1st to June 30th.</p><p> </p><p>An ‘in advance’ subscription plan can be activated at any time (e.g. on April 10th). In this case, the subscription fee is pro-rated so that the customer is charged for the actual service usage (i.e. 20 days covering the period from April 10th to April 30th).</p><p> </p><p>Let’s say that John signs up for the service on April 10th. As described above, as soon as the subscription is activated, PortaBilling® applies the $10 activation fee and the $20 periodic fee (i.e. a daily fee [$30 monthly fee / 30 days] * 20 days’ usage) to John’s balance.  </p><p> </p><p>At the end of April, PortaBilling® applies an ‘in advance’ subscription charge for May. Thus, on May 1st John receives his invoice with charges for calls made in April plus the $60 subscription charge that covers:</p></li><li>the $10 activation fee,</li><li>the $20 periodic fee from April 10th to April 30th and</li><li>the $30 periodic fee from May 1st to May 31st. <p> </p><p>You can charge your customers several billing periods in advance. In this case, PortaBilling® applies the full ‘in advance’ charge in the first billing period and then updates the subscription charges later on. </p><p> </p><p>Have a closer look at this case. Let’s say that you charge your customers 3 months in advance for their IP phone rental. Once Mark Roe signs up for the service on April 20th his subscription plan is activated. The $20 charge is applied to Marks’s balance ($10 activation fee plus a $10 periodic fee) for the period from April 20th to April 30th. </p><p> </p><p>At the end of April, PortaBilling® calculates Mark’s charges and applies the subscription charge for 3 months in advance. Therefore, on May 1st Mark receives his invoice and sees charges for calls made in April plus the subscription charge of $110 that covers:</p></li><li>the $10 activation fee,</li><li>the $10 periodic fee from April 20th to April 30th, </li><li>the $30 periodic fee from May 1st to May 31st, </li><li>the $30 periodic fee from June 1st to June 30th and</li><li>the $30 periodic fee from July 1st to July 31st.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p>At the end of May, PortaBilling® detects that Mark’s subscription charges cover only 2 months out of 3, since May is already paid for. Therefore, PortaBilling® applies a one-month subscription charge ($30) which brings the total subscription charge to 3 months in advance once more.</p><p> </p><p>On June 1st Mark receives his invoice and sees charges for calls made in May plus a subscription charge for $30 that covers his IP phone rental for the period from August 1st to August 31st.</p><h4>Subscriptions charged in advance to prepaid customers</h4><p>In most cases, subscriptions charged in advance are assigned to prepaid customers. Therefore, an administrator must be sure that customers have sufficient funds to cover their subscriptions. When they don’t, the customers’ service is suspended.</p><p> </p><p>The subscription plan configuration includes an option for automatically suspending prepaid customers’ service when their funds are not sufficient to cover pending subscription charges. </p><p> </p><p>This is how it works:</p><ul data-start="218" xmlns=""><li>Customers who have sufficient available funds have their subscription charges applied normally.</li><li>Customers who have insufficient available funds are automatically suspended and no longer receive the service. Therefore, no subscription charges are generated. As soon as funds become available, the service is resumed and new charges are generated.</li></ul><p> </p><p>An administrator has the authority to suspend service due to insufficient funds for either a specific customer or for an entire customer class. </p><p> </p><p>Let us consider the following example:</p><p>The customer has $20 available funds and is assigned a $30 monthly subscription for DID number usage charged a month in advance.</p><p> </p><p>On November 1st the system calculates the subscription charges for the period between November 1st and November 30th ($30) and compares that to the amount of available funds ($20). The available funds are insufficient, thus the customer’s service is immediately suspended. </p><p> </p><p>On November 5th the customer makes a $50 payment, so the available funds now total $70.</p><p> </p><p>The system recalculates the subscription charges. The customer did not use the service until November 5th, so the subscription charges are generated for the period starting November 5th (the day the customer became unsuspended and began using the services again) ending on November 30th ($26). These charges are then compared to the amount of available funds ($70), and applied. The amount of available funds then becomes $44. Therefore the customer’s service is reinstated. (Please see the Invoicing section in the <a href="http://www.portaone.com/support/documentation/">Unified PortaSwitch Handbook Collection</a> for a detailed description of the invoicing process.)</p><p>NOTE: After a suspension status is lifted from a customer, the system applies charges for the whole billing period ($30) and generates a refund for any period during which service is suspended (4* $30/30 = $4 where 4 is the number of days of suspension, $30 is the total for subscription charges and 30 is the number of days in the billing period). This refund is granted to the customer and two xDRs are created: one for the whole subscription charge ($30) and another for the refund amount (-$4).</p><p>If the customer doesn’t top up their balance in November, the following happens: PortaBilling® recalculates the customer’s subscription charges each day to cover the remaining billing period and compares that with the funds available ($20). Since the customer is not charged for the day they are suspended, the sum of subscription charges decreases by the daily fee ($1). As soon as it equals the customer’s available funds ($20), PortaBilling® charges the customer and resumes their service. </p><p> </p><p>PortaBilling® applies the charge for the whole billing period ($30) and immediately issues a refund for 10 days of suspension. Thus, there are two xDRs produced for the customer: one xDR is for the whole subscription charge ($30) and another is for the refund amount (-$10).</p><p> </p><p>Thus, prepaid customers can only consume services when they have sufficient available funds to cover their next subscription charges. </p><h5><a id="_Auto-charging_for_subscriptions"></a><a id="_Hlk6840395"></a>Subscriptions charged in advance to debit accounts</h5><p>An administrator can automatically block services for debit accounts when funds are insufficient to cover pending subscription charges. As soon as an account once again has sufficient funds to pay for the subscription, the service is resumed.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image118.png" width="462.8" height="175.4" alt="Enable the “Block debit accounts” option."/></p><p> </p><p>When the account is not charged for the days they do not use the service, PortaBilling® will issue a refund for the period during which the account was blocked.</p><h3>Auto-charging for subscriptions</h3><p>Another popular business model for applying subscription charges is to automatically deduct them from customers’ credit cards. The service provider maintains a “service balance” for customers, that is, they may only spend their funds on service usage such as international calls, SMS, etc. This prevents situations in which the available funds are consumed by subscription charges. </p><p> </p><p>To automatically charge customers for their subscriptions, configure a customer class as follows:</p><ul data-start="1.159" xmlns=""><li><ul data-start="1.159"><li>Enable the Separate Invoice for Recurring Fees option;</li><li>Enable the Automatic credit card charge option;</li><li>Specify the invoice template;</li><li>Specify the grace period in the Payment is expected within _ days after invoice generation option. For example, 5 days;</li><li>Specify when to charge the credit card for the unpaid invoice in the Automatic credit card charge after the due date, days option. For example, 2 days after the invoice due date. <p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image119.png" width="460.8" height="228.5" alt="Auto-charge for subscriptions"/></p><p> </p><p>This is how it works:</p><p>The sum of subscription charges and calculated taxes for those charges is generated as a separate invoice at the end of the billing period. The invoice amount is automatically deducted from the customer’s credit card, thus leaving the amount of available funds intact. </p><p> </p><p>If the payment transaction is unsuccessful (e.g. if the credit card is expired or there are insufficient funds on it), the invoice remains unpaid and a corresponding notification is sent to the customer.</p><p> </p><p>The customer has some grace period days for updating their credit card information. During the grace period the amount of available funds remains unchanged because a special correction xDR for the sum of the invoice is generated and inserted into the database. Thus, the customer can continue to use other services, such as make international calls. </p><p>NOTE: An invoice that contains subscription charges and taxes is paid automatically by a credit card only and cannot be paid manually via the web interface.</p><p>If credit card information is not updated within the grace period, the customer’s service is suspended until the credit card information has been updated and the payment has gone through.</p><p> </p><p>Consider the following example:</p><p>Prepaid customer John Doe has $15 in available funds and signs up for a $10 monthly subscription on April 1st. He is charged 10% in taxes for service usage.</p><p> </p><p>During April, John Doe makes international calls that total $6. His amount of available funds is now $9.</p><p> </p><p>On May 1st two invoices are produced for him:</p></li><li>An invoice that covers the $10 subscription charge and $1 tax ($10 * 10% = $1). This is an out-of-turn invoice in PortaBilling®.</li><li>An invoice that covers $6 for voice calls. Since this is a prepaid customer the invoice status is “do not pay.”<p> </p><p>These invoices are mostly used for administrative accounting and are not usually sent to customers.</p><p> </p><p>The sum of the out-of-turn invoice ($10 + $1 = $11) is automatically deducted from John’s credit card so the status of the invoice is “paid.”</p><p> </p><p>In May, John makes international calls totaling $7, therefore his amount of available funds is now $2. The invoices produced for him in June are as follows:</p></li><li>An out-of-turn invoice that covers his $10 subscription charge and a $1 tax; and</li><li>An invoice that covers $7 for voice calls and has a “do not pay” status. <p> </p><p>On May 31st John’s credit card expires, and consequently the out-of-turn invoice is not paid. The correction xDR for the sum of this invoice ($-11) is generated and inserted into the database, leaving the amount of available funds unchanged ($2).</p><p> </p><p>On June 2nd John updates his credit card and the payment transaction for the out-of-turn invoice is successful. The invoice status becomes “paid” and the correction xDR is removed from the database.</p><p> </p><p>If John did not update his credit card, his service would be suspended on June 3rd and terminated on June 18th.</p><p> </p><p>With auto-charging for subscriptions, there is improved cash flow since there is pre-defined recurring revenue. </p><p> </p><p>Customers are better able to control their available funds since these funds are only used for services.</p><h3>Subscription refunds </h3><p>A customer may close a subscription prior to the end date of the period that has already been charged for (e.g. the customer already paid for all of May but cancels his subscription on May 20th). Then a refund is issued for the ‘unused’ subscription time (e.g. 11 days). </p><p> </p><p>After the end date of the subscription plan the refund is calculated and immediately applied to the customer’s balance. The refund will then be reflected on the customer’s invoice at the end of the billing period.</p><h3>Waiving the subscription fee when no service was provided </h3><p>Service providers can choose whether or not to apply subscription charges for periods when their customers do not have access to services. </p><p> </p><p>For example, customer John Doe is provided Internet service on a subscription-based model. The service provider decides not to charge John Doe for those periods when he does not have access to the service. </p><p> </p><p>An administrator enables the Waive the charges for the days when no service was provided option for John Doe’s subscription.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image120.png" width="460.2" height="368.0" alt="Waive charges"/></p><p> </p><p>On September 15th, John Doe reaches his credit limit. He cannot use the services until he tops up his balance. Due to financial problems, John Doe doesn’t top up his balance until October 1st, so subscription charges for the period of September 15th – September 30th are not applied.  </p><p> </p><p>With the Waive the charges for the days when no service was provided option selected, subscription charges are withheld for periods when:</p></li><li>A customer is suspended because of an overdue invoice.</li><li>A customer or an individual account has reached the credit limit. </li><li>A customer or an individual account has no available funds. </li><li>A customer or an individual account is administratively blocked.</li><li>An account is expired. </li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p>This approach increases overall customer satisfaction and encourages customers to continue using your services.  </p><h3>Subscription discounts</h3><h4>Discounts on subscriptions</h4><p>Every subscription can have a custom discount rate (applied only to subscription’s periodic fees), with the actual charged amount adjusted accordingly. Therefore, if a subscription plan defines the periodic fee as $10.00, and this particular subscription is assigned a 20% discount rate, a charge of only $8.00 is produced.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image121.png" width="460.8" height="301.5" alt="Discount on subscriptions"/></p><p> </p><p>Use a 0 (zero) discount rate to specify “no discount” and ensure that charges are made according to the subscription plan definition. If a subscription has an empty discount rate, the customer default discount rate is used (see below).</p><h4>Customer discounts</h4><p>To simplify the management of different discount tiers (e.g. all your “silver” customers get 10% off the monthly fee for any of their subscriptions) you can directly assign a discount rate to a customer. So instead of creating multiple subscription plans with different periodic fee values, you will have a single set of subscription plans. You can then simply assign discount rates (10%, 20%, etc.) to customers. Any subscription (either directly applied to the customer or associated with one of the customer’s accounts) that does not have an explicitly assigned discount rate will then be charged using this discount.</p><h4>Prepay plans for subscriptions charged in advance</h4><p>To improve your cash flow, you can encourage your customers to pay monies in advance by offering them different prepay plans within subscriptions that are charged in advance (e.g. “Pre-pay for 6 months and get 20% off for Internet” or “Pay for 12 months and save $100 for IPTV!”). </p><p> </p><p>An administrator can set the number of months and choose a discount value, which will either be a percentage (e.g. 20%), or a fixed sum (e.g. $20). </p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image122.png" width="461.5" height="222.7" alt="Prepay plans"/></p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image123.png" width="460.2" height="228.5" alt="Subscription configuration"/></p><p> </p><p>Then when assigning a subscription to a customer or an account, a corresponding prepay plan can be selected.</p><p> </p><p>Consider the following example:</p><p> </p><p>In October 2015 customer John Doe signs up for the IPTV service with a $19.99 / monthly fee charged in advance. He has two options for paying for the service:</p><ul data-start="220" xmlns=""><li>10% discount for 6 months <br/>‎<span></span><span>($19.99*6 - 10% = $119.94 - $11.99 = $107.95);</span></li><li>20% discount for 12 months <br/>‎<span></span><span>($19.99*12 - 20% = $239.88 – $47.98 = $191.90).</span></li></ul><p> </p><p>John Doe chooses the 12-month payment plan so he is charged $191.90 and saves $47.98 (i.e. an xDR with this sum is created and inserted into the database). These charges are then reflected on his October invoice.</p><p> </p><p>Moreover, he is not bothered with monthly payments until the end of the prepaid period (his invoices for the next 11 months will not include subscription charges since they have already been paid). The next subscription charge will occur in 12 months’ time (i.e. in October 2016.)</p><p> </p><p>Thus, customers have the option to choose how to pay for their services. When paying months in advance, they receive a discount on services and, as a result, save money.</p><p> </p><p>ITSPs in turn improve their cash-flow, charging their customers for several billing periods at once and receiving larger sums as advance payment.</p><p> </p><p>NOTE: In case of early closure of a subscription charged in advance, a refund will be issued for the “unused” subscription time not later than one day after the subscription closes.</p></div></body></html>
