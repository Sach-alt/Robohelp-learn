This requires an invoice that is separate from the “normal” invoice generated at the end of the billing period. You can generate an out-of-turn invoice (to cover only a few specific items) on demand.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../assets/images/PortaBilling_Admin_Guide_MR82_files/image233.png" width="462.1" height="241.3" alt="Charge for out-of-turn invoice"/></p><p> </p><p>For example, let’s say your customer orders 10 additional IP phones for new employees. In this case, you just issue an invoice to cover the cost of those phones and send it to the customer. Once the customer pays, you fill the order.</p><p> </p><p>All you need to generate an invoice is to apply one or more “Manual Charge” transactions that contain a description(s) that will be visible for a customer and then mark it / them as Include in Out-of-Turn Invoice. You can then generate an out-of-turn invoice with these transactions on the Invoice On Demand page. </p><p> </p><p>Transactions included in an out-of-turn invoice won’t be reflected in the regular invoice issued at the end of the customer’s billing period. Thereafter, if one or more transactions aren’t included in a generated out-of-turn invoice during the corresponding billing period, they will be reflected in the regular invoice issued at the end of the customer’s billing period.</p></div></body></html>
